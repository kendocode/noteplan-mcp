# NotePlan MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes NotePlan's note, task, calendar, reminders, and plugin management to AI assistants like Claude.

Works with **Claude Desktop** and **Claude Code**. Claude Desktop is great for conversational workflows — planning your day, reviewing tasks, asking questions about your notes. Claude Code is ideal for batch operations and automation — bulk edits, plugin development, or scripting complex workflows across many notes.

## What You Can Do

Once installed, just talk to Claude naturally. Here are some examples:

**Notes & Tasks**
- "What's on my schedule today?"
- "Show me all open tasks tagged #urgent"
- "Add a task to my Daily Note: call the dentist at 3pm"
- "Summarize my meeting notes from last week"
- "Move all tasks from 'Inbox' to '20 - Areas/Work'"
- "What did I write about the product launch?"

**Calendar & Reminders**
- "What meetings do I have tomorrow?"
- "Create a calendar event for Friday at 2pm: Design Review"
- "Remind me to submit the report by end of day"
- "Show me all reminders due this week"

**Organization**
- "List all notes in my Projects folder"
- "Create a new note called 'Q1 Planning' in my Work folder"
- "Rename the 'Old Ideas' folder to 'Archive'"
- "Which tags am I using the most?"

**Plugins & Themes**
- "What plugins do I have installed?"
- "Create a plugin that adds word counts to my daily notes"
- "Switch to dark mode"
- "Show me available plugins I can install"

## Installation

Requires **Node.js 18+**. Check with `node -v`, or install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (`brew install node`) or [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add noteplan -- npx -y @noteplanco/noteplan-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Open **Settings > Developer > Edit Config** and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "noteplan": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@noteplanco/noteplan-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Save and restart Claude Desktop.

### Optional: Semantic Embeddings

To enable semantic search, add environment variables to the config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "noteplan": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@noteplanco/noteplan-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "NOTEPLAN_EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED": "true",
        "NOTEPLAN_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER": "openai",
        "NOTEPLAN_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "NOTEPLAN_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "NOTEPLAN_EMBEDDINGS_BASE_URL": "https://api.openai.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `NOTEPLAN_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER`: `openai` (default), `mistral`, or `custom`.
- `NOTEPLAN_EMBEDDINGS_BASE_URL`: for `custom`, assumes OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings`.
- `NOTEPLAN_EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED`: defaults to `false`; when false, embeddings tools are not listed.
- `NOTEPLAN_READ_ONLY`: defaults to `false`; when `true`, all write actions are rejected. Useful for read-only MCP clients.
- `NOTEPLAN_SKIP_DRY_RUN`: defaults to `false`; when `true`, skips the two-step dryRun/confirmationToken flow for write actions. This halves the number of tool calls for writes — useful for bulk operations or when the per-turn tool call limit is a bottleneck.
- `NOTEPLAN_MCP_AUTOLAUNCH`: defaults to `true`; the bridge discovery probe may activate NotePlan via AppleScript so subsequent tool calls go through NotePlan instead of direct container access (which avoids macOS Files & Folders prompts). Set to `false` to keep the probe passive — NotePlan stays closed when it's not already running, and tools fall back to the SQLite/FS path.
- `NOTEPLAN_ALLOWED_FOLDERS` / `NOTEPLAN_DENIED_FOLDERS`: optional folder-level access control. **Both default to empty, in which case the MCP behaves exactly as it does without these variables — every folder is accessible and no extra checks run.** Set one or both as a comma-separated list of folder prefixes when you want to scope the MCP's view of your vault.
  - `NOTEPLAN_ALLOWED_FOLDERS` — when set, ONLY paths inside the listed prefixes are reachable. Everything else is hidden. Example: `"NOTEPLAN_ALLOWED_FOLDERS": "Work, Projects, Calendar"` exposes `Notes/Work`, `Notes/Projects`, and the entire `Calendar` tree.
  - `NOTEPLAN_DENIED_FOLDERS` — when set, the listed prefixes are blocked even if the allowlist would otherwise include them. Example: `"NOTEPLAN_DENIED_FOLDERS": "Personal, Finance"` hides those project subtrees. Denylist wins over allowlist, so you can broadly allow `Notes` while carving out specific sensitive subfolders.
  - **Reads** (search, list, get, list-tags, list-folders) silently filter denied paths out of the response. **Writes** (create, update, delete, move, rename, restore, plus all folder-level operations) are rejected with a clear error so the agent knows it hit a configured boundary instead of silently misbehaving. Calendar notes can be denied: use `Calendar` (everything) or a sub-path like `Calendar/2026` (one yearFolders subtree).
  - **Path format**: bare entries are sugar for `Notes/<entry>`, since project notes always live under `Notes/`. So `Personal` and `Notes/Personal` are equivalent. `Notes/...` and `Calendar/...` are the two reserved top-levels and pass through unchanged. Whitespace, leading/trailing slashes, and backslashes are tolerated.
  - **Matching**: by path-prefix with directory-boundary awareness — `Personal` matches `Notes/Personal/Diary.md` but not `Notes/PersonalRecords.md`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from Source</strong> (for contributors and development)</summary>

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (`node -v`)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** — needed to compile the Swift calendar/reminders helpers (`xcode-select --install`)

#### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NotePlan/noteplan-mcp.git
cd noteplan-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

The `build` step compiles the TypeScript source and two Swift helper binaries (`calendar-helper` and `reminders-helper`) for native Calendar and Reminders access.

#### Verify

```bash
npm run smoke:workflow
```

#### Development

```bash
npm run dev   # watch mode — recompiles TypeScript on save
```

Then configure Claude Desktop or Claude Code to point at the local `dist/index.js` as shown above.

## Features

- **Unified Access**: Search and manage both local notes (file system) and teamspace notes (SQLite)
- **Full CRUD**: Create, read, update, and delete notes with flexible note targeting (id, filename, title, date, or query)
- **Task Management**: Add, complete, and update tasks with auto-formatted markers matching user settings
- **Calendar Events & Reminders**: Native macOS Calendar and Reminders integration via Swift helpers (`noteplan_eventkit`)
- **Plugin Management**: List, create, install, delete, and run NotePlan plugins; read source/logs; capture screenshots
- **Theme Management**: List, create, and activate themes
- **Filter Management**: Create, save, and execute task filters
- **UI Control**: Open notes, toggle sidebar, run plugin commands via AppleScript
- **Memory**: Persistent user preference memory for storing formatting/style preferences across sessions
- **Search**: Full-text search across all notes with frontmatter property filters, plus tag listing
- **Auto-Create Calendar Notes**: Editing a date that doesn't exist yet auto-creates the daily note (matches NotePlan native behavior)
- **Smart Folder Resolution**: Exact path matching with `Notes/` prefix support; fuzzy matching only as fallback
- **Structured Errors**: Tool failures include machine-readable `code` plus `hint`/`suggestedTool`
- **Applicable-Parameter Checking**: The write tools (`noteplan_edit_content`, `noteplan_manage_note`, and the write actions of `noteplan_paragraphs`) share one flat parameter schema across all their actions. A parameter the chosen action does not implement is refused with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_PARAM` naming the actions that do support it, rather than being silently dropped — notably `dryRun`, which is implemented by `delete_lines` and by manage_note's `delete`/`move`/`rename`/`restore`, and by no other action
- **Fast Repeated Lookups**: Short-lived in-memory caching for expensive list/resolve paths
- **Opt-in Timing Telemetry**: `debugTimings=true` adds `durationMs` and `stageTimings`
- **Safer TeamSpace Deletes**: TeamSpace deletes move notes into `@Trash`; list/search excludes trash by default
- **Optional Semantic Index**: Local embeddings index + semantic search (disabled by default; explicit opt-in)

## Available Tools (12)

All tools use action-based dispatch — one tool per domain, with an `action` parameter to select the operation.

### `noteplan_get_notes`
Unified note retrieval: get a single note, list notes, resolve references, fetch today/calendar/periodic notes, date ranges, or folder contents.
- Single note by `id`, `title`, `filename`, or `date`
- `resolve=true` — resolve a fuzzy reference to a canonical note
- `period` + `count` — recent periodic notes (e.g., last 6 weekly notes)
- `rangePeriod` or `startDate`/`endDate` — daily notes in date range
- `folder` — notes in a folder
- Fallback: list notes with optional filters

### `noteplan_manage_note`
Note lifecycle: `create`, `update`, `delete`, `move`, `restore`, `rename`, `set_property`, `remove_property`.

### `noteplan_edit_content`
Edit note content: `insert`, `append`, `delete_lines`, `edit_line`, `replace_lines`. All actions target notes via `id`, `filename`, `title`, `date`, or `query`. Calendar notes are auto-created when targeted by date.

### `noteplan_paragraphs`
Paragraph and task operations: `get` (line metadata), `search` (find lines in a note), `search_global` (tasks across all notes), `add` (task with auto-formatted marker), `complete`, `update`.

### `noteplan_search`
Search across notes or list tags.
- `action: "search"` (default) — full-text or metadata search with `searchField`, `queryMode`, `propertyFilters`
- `action: "list_tags"` — list all tags/hashtags with optional filtering

### `noteplan_folders`
Folder and space operations: `list`, `find`, `resolve`, `create`, `move`, `rename`, `delete`, `list_spaces`.

### `noteplan_filters`
Saved filter operations: `list`, `get`, `get_tasks`, `list_parameters`, `save`, `rename`.

### `noteplan_eventkit`
macOS Calendar and Reminders via `source` parameter.
- `source: "calendar"` — `get_events`, `list_calendars`, `create_event`, `update_event`, `delete_event`
- `source: "reminders"` — `get`, `list_lists`, `create`, `complete`, `update`, `delete`

### `noteplan_memory`
User preference memory: `list`, `save`, `update`, `delete`.

### `noteplan_ui`
NotePlan UI control: `open_note`, `open_today`, `search`, `run_plugin`, `open_view`, `toggle_sidebar`, `close_plugin_window`, `list_plugin_windows`.

### `noteplan_plugins`
Plugin management: `list`, `list_available`, `create`, `delete`, `install`, `log`, `source`, `update_html`, `screenshot`.

### `noteplan_themes`
Theme management: `list`, `get`, `save`, `set_active`.

### `noteplan_embeddings` (opt-in)
Embeddings/vector search: `status`, `search`, `sync`, `reset`. Only available when `NOTEPLAN_EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED=true`.

## Preferred Usage Flow

Prefer granular edits to avoid large context payloads and accidental full-note rewrites.

1. Find the note: `noteplan_get_notes` (by id/title/filename/date) or `noteplan_search`
2. Inspect content:
   - `noteplan_paragraphs(action: get)` for line metadata
   - `noteplan_paragraphs(action: search)` for text lookup inside a note
3. Apply targeted mutation:
   - `noteplan_edit_content(action: edit_line)` for one-line changes
   - `noteplan_edit_content(action: insert/append)` for adding content
   - `noteplan_edit_content(action: delete_lines)` for removals
   - All edit actions accept `id`, `filename`, `title`, `date`, or `query` to target the note
4. Use `noteplan_manage_note(action: update)` only for intentional full-note rewrites (`fullReplace=true`)
5. Destructive operations (delete, move, rename, restore) use a 2-step flow:
   - Step 1: call with `dryRun=true` to preview impact and get `confirmationToken`
   - Step 2: call again with that `confirmationToken` to execute
6. Calendar notes are auto-created when targeted by `date` — no need to create them first

Task flow:
1. Find tasks: `noteplan_paragraphs(action: search)` in one note, or `noteplan_paragraphs(action: search_global)` across notes
2. Mutate: `noteplan_paragraphs(action: complete)` or `noteplan_paragraphs(action: update)`

Property-filtered search:
- `noteplan_search` with `query` + `propertyFilters`, e.g. `query: "campaign", propertyFilters: {"category":"marketing"}`
- Folder filters accept canonical paths (e.g. `20 - Areas` or `Notes/20 - Areas`)

## Data Locations

The server automatically detects NotePlan's storage location. Supported paths (in order of preference):

**iCloud paths (preferred):**
- `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~co~noteplan~Today/Documents/`
- `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~co~noteplan~NotePlan3/Documents/`
- `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~co~noteplan~NotePlan/Documents/`
- `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~co~noteplan~NotePlan-setapp/Documents/`

**Local paths:**
- `~/Library/Containers/co.noteplan.NotePlan3/Data/Library/Application Support/co.noteplan.NotePlan3`
- `~/Library/Containers/co.noteplan.NotePlan-setapp/Data/Library/Application Support/co.noteplan.NotePlan-setapp`

**Teamspace Database:** `~/Library/Caches/teamspace.db`

## How It Works

- **Local notes**: Direct file system read/write. NotePlan auto-detects changes via FolderMonitor (~300ms delay)
- **Teamspace notes**: SQLite queries/updates. NotePlan sees changes on next sync cycle or app restart
- **Calendar & Reminders**: Native macOS access via compiled Swift helpers using EventKit
- **UI control & Plugins**: AppleScript bridge to the running NotePlan app

## Examples

### Example 1: Review today's schedule and tasks

**Prompt:** "What's on my plate today?"

**Tool calls:** `noteplan_get_notes` fetches today's daily note, then `noteplan_eventkit` retrieves calendar events for the day.

**Output:** Claude combines your daily note content (tasks, meeting prep, notes) with your calendar events into a unified overview of your day.

### Example 2: Search and complete a task

**Prompt:** "Mark the 'Submit quarterly report' task as done"

**Tool calls:** `noteplan_paragraphs` with `action: "search_global"` finds the task across all notes. Then `noteplan_paragraphs` with `action: "complete"` marks it done using your configured task marker style.

**Output:** The server returns the filename where the task was found, the original line, and the updated line with the completion marker applied.

### Example 3: Create a meeting note with a calendar event

**Prompt:** "Create a note called 'Design Review' in my Meetings folder and add a calendar event for Friday at 2pm"

**Tool calls:** `noteplan_manage_note` with `action: "create"` creates the note in the specified folder. Then `noteplan_eventkit` with `source: "calendar"` and `action: "create_event"` creates the event.

**Output:** The server confirms the note was created (returning filename, title, and folder) and the calendar event was added (returning event ID, title, start/end times, and calendar name).

### Example 4: Bulk search with filters

**Prompt:** "Find all notes tagged #project in my Work folder from the last month"

**Tool calls:** `noteplan_search` with `query: "#project"`, `folder: "Work"`, and date-based `propertyFilters`.

**Output:** The server returns matching notes with filenames, titles, modification dates, and content snippets showing the matched lines.

## Privacy Policy

The MCP server runs entirely on your machine. Your notes, tasks, and calendar data never leave your device. No telemetry or analytics are collected. If you enable optional semantic search, selected content is sent to a third-party embedding API that you configure. See the full privacy policy at [noteplan.co/privacy](https://noteplan.co/privacy).
